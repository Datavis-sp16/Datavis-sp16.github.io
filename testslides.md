### math  

$$ L^{A}T_{E}X $$  is copied and pasted from Grapher.  Use no spaces or special characters.  Use only regular characters and/or actual $$ \LaTeX $$ commands.
units: kludge: escape from latex for units, space around units, then back into latex.  Will only work for units on the main line.

$$ 
f(x) = 1/2x + .345 
$$

inline math $$ f(x) = 1/2x + .345 $$

(LaTeX enclosed in double dollar signs)

footnoting[^1]  
footnote auto-numbering is not implemented[^2]

[^1]: footnotes are automatically placed at the bottom of the page.

[^2]: footnotes in markdown should be auto-numbered, with arbitrary footnote references. This implementation requires manual numbering of footnotes to work properly.

inline footnotes^[text of note] will be implemented soon.
