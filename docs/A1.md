# Assignment 1: Visualization Re-Design###Preliminary Reading:<https://medium.com/@hint_fm/design-and-redesign-4ab77206cf9#.v06i9nc3o><http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/11/redesigning-visualizations.html>### Description: 
Redesign a static visualization of a small dataset.  Critique of existing visualizations by redesign has become a common method of public critique, stimulated by the wide availability of high level visualization tools and increasing awareness of vizualization in general.   For this assignment, you will design a visualization for a small data set which has already been visualized. You should be able to explain all your design choices and every element of your design.  You should also be prepared to make a side-by-side comparison of the original design and your re-design as a form of critique of the original.You may use any tool you please - including any off-the-shelf visualization solftware or hand drafting.  If you wish to use visualization software, it is recommended you start with a code-free online tool such as Plot.ly or Tableau, and export your initial results from that software as SVG for use inside Illustrator or other drawing program.  ### Data and Original Visualization:  <br>![](http://www.journalism.org/files/2014/10/PJ_14.10.21_mediaPolarization-00.png)### Context and Source:<http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/#media-sources-nearly-half-of-consistent-conservatives-cite-fox-news>See also, <http://dataremixed.com/2015/11/a-pew-chart-redesign/> for one person’s attempt to redesign the chart.

CSV file containing data for the above chart: [PewAmericanTrendsPanelWave1.csv](../datasets/PewAmericanTrendsPanelWave1.csv)### Deliverables1. A static visualization (single graphics) that effectively communicates the data. 	- You must use the given data set.	- You may transform the data in any way you see fit.  	- You may incorporate other data as you see fit. 	- Your visualization should be stand alone without your text. 	- You must include a chart title and appropriate axis labels or legends.	- Avoid misleading or extraneous graphic elements.	- Avoid inappropriate encodings (distracting colors, poor chart type choice, etc.) and unjustified data 	- transformations.    2. A short text critiquing the original visualization, explaining your design, and comparing the two.	For both the original and new design, explain what aspects of the data the visualizations are attempting to highlight or what findings the graphics are trying to communicate.  Explain what aspects of the data are being downplayed, and why.  Explain the visual encodings (visualization type, scale, color, etc.) used to represent the data and why these encodings are appropriate (or not) to the dataset.  Explain what sorting, filtering or other data transformations were perfomed, and why.  What works? What doesn’t?### EvaluationThe assignment will be evaluated primarily on the effectiveness of your visualization design and the clarity and thoroughness of your explanitory text and critique. The highest grades are reserved for the most exceptional, innovative or creative designs, and/or insightful and well written critique.### Submission and CritiqueDue Thursday, 1/21 before class.  We will briefly critique your submissions in class.  To submit, log in to ELC, select Tools>Assignment Dropbox, then select “Assignment 1 DROPBOX.” If you do not yet have access to ELC, please email me ahead of time.Upload a single PNG or JPG image file of your design, sized for on-screen viewing, and a plain text file (.txt) or “markdown” file (.md) containing your text. Be sure your name appears on the image and at the top of your text file.  The text file must be in plain text or markdown.  You may indicate ```*italics*``` and ```**bold**``` using single or double asterisk notation.  (You may indicate other formating with [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)).  I will place everyone’s text and image in a web page for viewing on screen.
