### Data Visualization (Spring 2016)[<<](http://datavis-sp16.github.io/) Back to course website
# Assignment 1: (Visual) Exploratory Data Analysis### Description: 
Use visualization to conduct exploratory data analysis on an existing dataset.

The goal of this assignment is to learn to use visualization as a tool to help you formulate and answer questions about data.  You will choose an existing dataset you are interested in, then use an off-the-shelf visualization tool to formulate and answer a series of questions, then produce a final visualization illustrating what you discovered.

You will keep a digital "process notebook" that documents all the questions you posed and steps you performed in order.A variety of digital tools have been designed to help users visually explore data sets and confirm or disconfirm hypotheses about the data. 

### Data sets

You can use one of the built-in dataset in Voyager or any similr software.  

If you like movies, you could use this dataset pertaining to a large sample of movies. (The data includes the budgets, revenued and ratings from various sources.) Download: [movies.csv](../datasets/movies.csv)
If you're a glutton for pubishment, you can look for data from one of the following sources:

### Process

**Step 1 - Choose your data**  

A number of sample datasets are built-in to many visualziation tools.  You are encouraged to use one of these, however, you may also chose any other dataset you find. You should choose a subject (and data) you are intersted in.

**Step 2 - Pose an initial question you want to answer.**

Write your question down clearly.  Example questions: 

- Is there a relationship between movie budgets and reviews?  
- Is there a correlation between crime levels and night-time street illumination?  
- How does income vary with age in the US?

**Step 3 - Assess the fitness of your data for answering your question; wrangle if needed.**

Loos at the data, starting with the raw data. Does the data seem appropriate to the question? If not, do you need to find different data or a new question? Does the  data need to be cleaned or formated first? Perform any steps necessary to get the data into shape prior to visual analysis.  (You might do this in Excel, for example).

**Step 4 - Explore**

Build a visualization that answers your initial question. As you build the visualization, you may find your question changes. It may become more specific, may seem like a wrong question. The visualization may suugest new questions. Track the history of your questions and how you answered them. Fully designed visualizationa re not needed at this point. This is a notebook of your exploratory process.

**Step 5 - Final Visualization**

After answering all the questions you have to your satisfaction, think of a way to word the final or most important answer(s)—your findings. Design a way to present the data and your findings as clearly as possible. Use visualization software tools (and an illustration program if needed) to produce a final image.  Write a caption for the final graphic, as well as a paragrph describing the graphic and your findings.

# Deliverables

**PDF notebook**

Describe the dataset in a sentence or two, and indicate where you found it (a link, or a named built-in dataset.)

List the software tool(s) you used.

Write down the initial question clearly. 

Write down a record of what you did to construct a visualization to answer the question, what you found, and how the questions evolved. Was there a new question?  Did you alter the question? Repeat for each new question and visualization you develop. Include copies of any intermediate visualizations that helped you refine your questions. End with your final visualization, caption, and descriptive paragraph. Think of the final graphic, the caption and the paragraph as material for an article.

Be sure to also describe any transformations or rearrangements of the dataset that you needed to perform, inlcuding how you got the data into the format needed by the visualization system. 

**Final Image, caption and paragraph**

Your final graphic will also be submitted as a separate JPG or PNG (in addition to being included in your PDF), and the caption and text will be included in a separate text file (see below), so that we can present them on screen.

### Submission and CritiqueDue Thursday, 2/16 before class.  We will critique the submissions in class.  To submit, log in to ELC, select Tools>Assignment Dropbox, then select “Assignment 2 DROPBOX.” If you do not yet have access to ELC, please email me ahead of time.Upload:

- your PDF notebook, named "a2-lastname.pdf"

- a single JPG (or PNG) image of your design, sized for on-screen viewing, named "a2-lastname.jpg" (or "a2-lastname.png")

- a plain text file named "a2-lastname.md" (or a2-lastname.md) using this template (uses simple [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) formatting):

Caption text to appear below the image.

A paragraph describing the visualization. Think of this as text you might include in an article accompanying the graphic.  Use only simple markdown formatting if needed. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Aliquam viverra purus lectus, a volutpat turpis malesuada sed. Suspendisse vulputate molestie enim, sed malesuada dui adipiscing ut. Aenean sagittis faucibus mi, quis hendrerit nisl bibendum sed. Integer lectus eros, luctus sit amet dapibus nec, condimentum rutrum magna. In vehicula est eget tempus imperdiet. Nunc aliquet est ante, quis euismod magna suscipit vel. Maecenas blandit nisi ut erat vestibulum viverra. Sed augue dui, congue nec sapien eu, facilisis interdum massa.

Gender discrepencies across blah blah over time.

Gender discrepencies are well known to exist in blah bah. The figure shows how gender correlates with whatever.  As the graph shows, the more blah, the less blah blah.  This might be a longer paraphraph.  Lorem ipsum, etc.
