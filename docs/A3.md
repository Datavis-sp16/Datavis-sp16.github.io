# Assignment 2: Web-embedded visualization  
Due March 21. Critique March 22, in class.Hello!
### Description: 
Create a visualization for the web.  You may (and probably should) work in teams of two to three people.

The goal of this assignment is to learn to use a visualization grammar or grammar-based toolkit to build a visualization intended for the web.  

Choose a topic you are interested in, find and prepare data, conduct exploratory data analysis, then produce a final visualization or set of visualizations telling a story about the data.  The visualizaiton should be presented in context, surround by explanatory text (described below) in a meaningful layout.

You should keep a process notebook for your own purposes to help you prepare the final product. You may use a variety of tools in the design and exploratory stage, such as Voyager, Illustrator, and pen and paper. Prepare a conceptual sketch of a final visualization on paper. 

Examples:

You will include some of your process materials and your final sketch your final deliverables.

You must implement your final design entirely in software, either a visualization grammar (Vega, not vega-lite), or a grammar-based tool like Plotly, Tableau, Lyra, or library like D3 or D3 extensions, that let you have sufficient control over design.  The final design should be embedded or rendered in the browser directly, and should not be artwork constructed by hand in Illustrator.  The challenge is to do all the design using the grammar-based tools.### Deliverables

A live single web page (or multi-page site) containing the following:

* Title  
* Names of participants, with contribution credits (who did what)  
* A description of the data and questions posed.  
* A short summary of what you discovered in data exploration, early experiments, storyboarded interactions, etc., (text/png/jpeg,etc.)  
* The final paper sketch (png/jpeg)  
* The final implemented visualization (rendered in browser) with any needed explanations, captions or instructions.  
* Reflextions on design choices, the process of implementing your concept, technical challenges, next steps, etc.
* Links to source code (html, vega, etc.) and data source with links to data.  This can simply be a Gist, with everything in it, or separate links.**Examples:**

Concept: [http://arthurche.com/projects/sfo/](http://arthurche.com/projects/sfo/)
Final: [http://thegilby.com/projects/sfo/demo](http://thegilby.com/projects/sfo/demo)

See also Bl.ocks.org, D3 examples.

Your final web page or pages should have a simple layout and minimal navigation. One or two pages should be sufficient. The writing, order of content and layout must all be carefully considered. You may use any combination of HTML, CSS, Markdown, SVG, Javascript, or any other standard tools. Refrain from using off-the-shelf designs (wordpress, etc.). You can integrate this content with your own website later if you wish, but think of this for now as a stand-alone project page.

Submit a single link to the project web page to me via email by midnight, March 21.
# Methods for pubishing### Gist &rarr; Bl.ocks.org
*Page renders in an iframe with code displayed below.  Can also display fully rendered web page. Updates immediately.*

Create a "Gist" on [gist.github.com](gist.github.com).  (You can create an anonmous Gist, or log in to GitHub/Gist and create a Gist under your account.)

Add or create files, including an html file and any other content your page needs to render, like a vega .json file.

Publish the Gist as "Secret" or "Public." (Anonymous Gists are always public.)

Go to your Gist. Copy the Gist number and paste into a bl.ocks.org URL:

for example:  
[https://gist.github.com/allopole/<mark>97134939a3aa3ff50262</mark>](https://gist.github.com/allopole/97134939a3aa3ff50262)

[http://bl.ocks.org/<mark>97134939a3aa3ff50262</mark>](http://bl.ocks.org/97134939a3aa3ff50262)

Bl.ocks will find your Github User ID and insert it. (Or, you can put it in yourself.)

[http://bl.ocks.org/<mark>allopole/97134939a3aa3ff50262</mark>](http://bl.ocks.org/allopole/97134939a3aa3ff50262)

The "Open" link on your bl.ocks.org page opens the fully rendered content without an iframe or code view.  You can also manually insert "raw/" into the URL before the Gist number.

[http://bl.ocks.org/allopole/<mark>raw/</mark>97134939a3aa3ff50262/](http://bl.ocks.org/allopole/raw/97134939a3aa3ff50262/)

### Bit.Ly

You can create a short URL on Bit.Ly, Goo.gl, or other URL shortenning service.  You can use Bit.Ly + Bl.ocks as a quick way to publish just about anything.

### GitHub
*Absolutely free hosting. Version control.  (Relatively) easy to publish.  No "dynamic content" i.e. wordpress, etc., but all "static content" is fine.*

*[xkcd.com/1597 – "Git"](http://xkcd.com/1597/)*

[Github](https://github.com) is a way to manage projects, both individual and collaborative. Collaborators each maintain a copy of the project folder (called a "Repository") on any computer anywhere.  Github syncs everyone's contributions and keeps track of all edits.  Much more reliable than Dropbox, but not as easy to set up.

With "Github Pages", you can create a full website hosted for free.  If you have bought a domain name from someone, you can even redirect to your GitHub Pages site for free (using a "[CNAME](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-repository/)".)

1. Create a Github account if you don't have one already.  Your github handle will look like a Twitter Handle (@user).

2. Create a repository for your project.  Name it appropriately and simply.

3. From the repository, create a "Branch" called ```gh-pages```.  This will be where the website for your project lives.

	reference: [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

4. Download Github Desktop app: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) and get familiar with it. You will link the desktop with your github account.

5. From the Github Desktop app, “clone the repository” to create the working copy on local computer.

	See [https://help.github.com/desktop/](https://help.github.com/desktop/) for how to do all this.

6. Your public URL will be **http://[user].github.io/[project]**

You can work locally on your machine and preview in your own browser.  To sync your local copy of the project with GitHub, go into the GitHub Desktop app, review the changes that appear, "Commit" and "Sync."  Within a minute or so, the changes should be live on your website.
