### Gist &rarr; Bl.ocks.org
*Page renders in an iframe with code displayed below.  Can also display fully rendered web page. Updates immediately.*

Create a "Gist" on [gist.github.com](gist.github.com).  (You can create an anonmous Gist, or log in to GitHub/Gist and create a Gist under your account.)

Add or create files, including an html file and any other content your page needs to render, like a vega .json file.

Publish the Gist as "Secret" or "Public." (Anonymous Gists are always public.)

Go to your Gist. Copy the Gist number and paste into a bl.ocks.org URL:

for example:  
[https://gist.github.com/allopole/<mark>97134939a3aa3ff50262</mark>](https://gist.github.com/allopole/97134939a3aa3ff50262)

[http://bl.ocks.org/<mark>97134939a3aa3ff50262</mark>](http://bl.ocks.org/97134939a3aa3ff50262)

Bl.ocks will find your Github User ID and insert it. (Or, you can put it in yourself.)

[http://bl.ocks.org/<mark>allopole/97134939a3aa3ff50262</mark>](http://bl.ocks.org/allopole/97134939a3aa3ff50262)

The "Open" link on your bl.ocks.org page opens the fully rendered content without an iframe or code view.  You can also manually insert "raw/" into the URL before the Gist number.

[http://bl.ocks.org/allopole/<mark>raw/</mark>97134939a3aa3ff50262/](http://bl.ocks.org/allopole/raw/97134939a3aa3ff50262/)

### Bit.Ly

You can create a short URL on Bit.Ly, Goo.gl, or other URL shortenning service.  You can use Bit.Ly + Bl.ocks as a quick way to publish just about anything.

### GitHub
*Absolutely free hosting. Version control.  (Relatively) easy to publish.  No "dynamic content" i.e. wordpress, etc., but all "static content" is fine.*

[Github](https://github.com) is a way to manage projects, both individual and collaborative. Collaborators each maintain a copy of the project folder (called a "Repository") on any computer anywhere.  Github syncs everyone's contributions and keeps track of all edits.  Much more reliable than Dropbox, but not as easy to set up.

With "Github Pages", you can create a full website hosted for free.  If you have bought a domain name from someone, you can even redirect to your GitHub Pages site for free (using the "CNAME" method. Ask your domain provider how to set it up.)

1. Create a Github account if you don't have one already.  Your github handle will look like a Twitter Handle (@user).

2. Create a repository for your project.  Name it appropriately and simply.

3. From the repository, create a "Branch" called ```gh-pages```.  This will be where the website for your project lives.

	reference: [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

4. Download Github Desktop app: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) and get familiar with it. You will link the desktop with your github account.

5. From the Github Desktop app, “clone the repository” to create the working copy on local computer.

	See https://help.github.com/desktop/ for how to do all this.

6. Your public URL will be http://[user].github.io/[project]

You work locally on your machine.  So sync your local copy of the project with all other copies out there through GitHub, go into the GitHub Desktop app, review the changes, "Commit" and "Sync."  Within a minute or so, the changes should be live on your website.
