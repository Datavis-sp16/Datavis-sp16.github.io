# UGA Fullbright Assistance
Fulbright student grants are designed to give recent B.S./B.A. graduates, masters and doctoral candidates, and young professionals and artists opportunities for personal development and international experience. Grantees plan their own programs. Projects may include university coursework, independent library or field research, classes in a music conservatory or art school, special projects in the social or life sciences, or a combination of these areas. A limited number of travel grants are available to selected countries as well as grants for teaching English in secondary schools.

# My Experience as a Panelist for the Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation

- Four panelists from outside of Mid-Atlantic region
- No artist names or identifying information given
- Review is based on images of work and the quality of the photographic documentation 
- Review process occurred in several rounds
- In the first review, we simply scored the artists, and were given a short accompanying text if it was asked for by the panelists
- In the second review, we looked at the artists that received the highest scores, and had more discussion among the panelists
- Lots of disagreement â€“ a different panel would result in different finalists
