Many (though not all) of the principles of 2D and 3D visual design and composition can be applied to the visualization of time-based phenomena or to the design of time-based media, by **imagining or mapping time to a physical dimension**.  

**Cross-domain mapping:** Thinking of one set of phenomena in terms of another set of phenomena. Imagining time as a physical dimension is an example of this.

It is probably easiest to think of time as the horizontal dimension, to map time to the horizontal dimension on a piece of paper.  Equipped with this spatial metaphor for time, you can imagine how a concept from 2D design like “line” is applied to time.
