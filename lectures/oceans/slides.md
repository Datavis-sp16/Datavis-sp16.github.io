# Warming

The ocean soaks up a lot of the extra heat that's coming with global warming.  

### Why is that dangerous?

# Acidification

class: center, middle

# Acidification

### Carbon dioxide dissolves in sea water.  

### Chemical reactions with the carbon dioxide make the ocean more acidic.  

### Calcium carbonate dissolves in acid.

### Pteropods

The pteropod, or “sea butterfly”, is a tiny sea creature about the size of a small pea. Pteropods are eaten by organisms ranging in size from tiny krill to whales and are a major food source for North Pacific juvenile salmon. The photos below show what happens to a pteropod’s shell when placed in sea water with pH and carbonate levels projected for the year 2100. The shell slowly dissolves after 45 days.
