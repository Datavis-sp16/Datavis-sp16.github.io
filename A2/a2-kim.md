One thing that they track are rates of cat and dog ownership among different states. Top ten pet-owning states are Vermont (70.8%), New Mexico (67.6%), South Dakota (65.6%), Oregon (63.6%), Maine (62.9%), Washington (62.7%), Arkansas (62.4%), West Virginia (62.1%), Idaho (62%) and Wyoming (61.8%) in order. The state of Arkansas has the highest percentage of households that own a dog (47.9%) and Vermont the highest that own a cat (49.5%). In contrast, the state of Illinois has the lowest percentage of households that own a dog (32.4%) and California the lowest that own a cat (28.3%). New York and Delaware are evenly split: in New York, 29% of households own cats, and about the same proportion own dogs, and in Delaware, cat owning and dog owning households are tied at about 33.7% each. The South is much more favorable to dogs than to cats. In Arkansas, 48% of households own dogs, but just 31% own cats. One final observation is that neither cats nor dogs are overly common in Washington, DC. Only 13% of households in the capital own dogs, and just 12% own cats.
