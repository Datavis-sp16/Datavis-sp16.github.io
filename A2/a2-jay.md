### Chelsea JayAssignment 2Data: [here]( http://vega.github.io/voyager/)[Process Notebook] (a2-jay.pdf)---![](a2-jay.png)DVD sales decrease as MPAA rating increase.---The inital question that was raised when reviewing data was if DVD sales were either impacted or not by DVD MPAA rating. Through research and inserting different data, I narrowed it down to these data sets. When looking at this visual, one can deduce that as US movie genre’s increase in MPAA ratings, US DVD sales decrease. I wonder if Directors should start rethinking things when approaching the big screen.
